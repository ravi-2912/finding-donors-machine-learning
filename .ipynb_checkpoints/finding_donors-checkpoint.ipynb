    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Support Vector Machines (Support Vector Classifier):**\n",
    "    *  Commonly used in face detection, image classifications, handwriting recognition, etc.\n",
    "    *  *Advantages* : \n",
    "       - Maximum margin classifiers, effective in high dimensional spaces\n",
    "       - Have higher accuracy than some of traditional classifiers and not easily influenced by overfitting.\n",
    "    *  **Disadvantages** :\n",
    "       - Less effective on noisier-larger datasets with overlapping classes.\n",
    "       - The training time is much longer because it is computationally intensive.\n",
    "       - Doesn’t directly provide probability estimates.\n",
    "    *  *Selection for CharityML* :\n",
    "       - SVMs were chosen because of their effectiveness given high dimensionality. Due to our one-hot encoding feature transformation, i.e. after incorporating dummy variables, we got more than 100 features in our dataset, so SVMs should be a classifier that works regardless of that. Also, our dataset is not that large(<100k records) to be a deterrent.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Random Forest Classifier:**\n",
    "    *  Commonly used in banking, stock market, e-commerce, medicine, etc.\n",
    "    *  *Advantaghes* : \n",
    "       - Scale quickly, have ability to deal with unbalanced and missing data\n",
    "       - Can be used for both regression and classification tasks and that it’s easy to view the relative importance it assigns to the input features\n",
    "       - Provides an experimental way to detect variable interactions.\n",
    "    *  *Disadvantages* :\n",
    "       - Less effective on noisier-larger datasets with overlapping classes.\n",
    "       - large number of trees may lead to slow real-time prediction in some cases.\n",
    "    *  **Selection for CharityML** :\n",
    "       - RandomForest are always a safe bet as they generally have high average accuracy rate for most cases and work well for complex classification tasks as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gradient Boosting Classifier:**\n",
    "    *  Commonly used in numerical problems, physics and statistics,etc.\n",
    "    *  *Advantages* : \n",
    "       - It builds new trees which complement the already built trees. The new trees which will be built will help to correct errors in the previously built trees. This can produce highly accurate results with less trees.\n",
    "       - Can handle different types of predictor variables and accomodate missing data.\n",
    "    *  *Disadvantages* :\n",
    "       - Unable to compute conditional class probabilites\n",
    "       - Suffers from long sequential computation times.\n",
    "       - More parameters to tune.\n",
    "    *  *Selection for CharityML* :\n",
    "       - Since, this model produces good accurate results, this makes it a very good candidate for the problem."

    "To understand gradient boosting we must first understand two important aspects of it: 1.Descison Trees 2.Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Descion Trees:** \n",
    "      - This is basically defined as a decision support tool that uses tree like structure/model of decisions and their possible consequences. Here each node of the tree is a \"test\"(question),each branch is outcome of this test and each leaf represents a class label which we are trying to predict.\n",
    "      - So,by answering certain set questions one by one realting to the system we end up with potentially correct or incorrect answers,The strategy here is that the first set of questions have to be broad in order to eliminate multiple outcomes and the last few questions have to be very specific to get the correct outcomes.\n",
    "      - Finally,we end you with a big tree which has all the possible outcomes of all decisons and can be used to predict furture outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Boosting:** \n",
    "      - This is best explained by an example of a factory worker,who is working in an assembly line and is trained to perform a specific task ,he/she performs well on in their local and very specific tasks but overall they can't do much and are quite weak for other tasks,but if we combine multiple workers each having different expertise/skills and make them work on their individual tasks,we end up making the final product efficiently.\n",
    "      - This is the basic idea behind boosting,here we bundle up multiple classifers and make a final model which works accurately in predicitng accross all areas of the dataset in question.\n",
    "        \n",
    "*Now,what Gradient Boosting actaully does is quite smart,it makes small and weak decision trees and checks how many outcomes it has misclassified,then it builds another tree which helps to correct the errors made by previous tree by changing some parameters.*\n",
    "       *This process keeps going on sequentially until we have reached a certain threshold of acceptable error rate and we end up with a single tree which is basically a combination of small weak decision trees.This final tree is more expressive and can address multiple areas efficiently.*"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

This is because the classifier is not being able to accurately capture the multi-dimensionality of the data and is unable to generalize. However, if the training time was an important factor, reducing the number of features should reduce training time. Furthermore, since the impact on the accuracy and/or the F-scores is not too large, the small increase in classification error could be an appropriate tradeoff in that scenario"
